# Home Loan Default Risk Management Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting home loan default risk. The project utilizes several machine learning algorithms to analyze a dataset with 122 columns and 307511 rows.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains 122 columns and 307511 rows. Each row represents a home loan applicant, and the columns contain various features related to the applicants' demographics, financial history, and other relevant factors.

## Algorithms Used
Several machine learning algorithms have been employed to predict home loan default risk. These algorithms include:
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosting

## Conclusion
After thorough analysis and evaluation of the performance of each algorithm, it has been concluded that the machine learning model utilizing **Gradient Boosting** has yielded the best performance in predicting home loan default. The model achieved an accuracy score of **73%**.

This accuracy score indicates that approximately 73% of the variability in the target variable, the home loan default prediction, is explained by the features included in the model.

## Future Work
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters of the Gradient Boosting model to potentially improve performance.
- Exploring ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models for enhanced accuracy.
- Investigating additional feature engineering techniques to extract more valuable insights from the dataset.
